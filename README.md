# Signal and Image Processing: Mathematical Foundations and Applications

### Overview

Signal and image processing are foundational pillars in modern data science, AI, and engineering. This repository presents a curated set of MATLAB codes and experiments that demonstrate the mathematical underpinnings and practical applications of core techniques such as Fourier analysis, convolution, clustering, and compression. Each script is designed to bridge theory and practice, providing both a learning resource and a toolkit for real-world problem solving in domains like Computer Vision, Audio Analytics, and Pattern Recognition.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Mathematical Insights

#### **Fourier Differentiation Property**

The derivative of a signal in the time domain corresponds to multiplication by \( j\omega \) in the frequency domain:

$$
\frac{d f(t)}{d t} \; \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \; j \omega F(\omega)
$$

This property enables **numerical differentiation** without finite difference approximations.

---

#### **Convolution Theorem**

Convolution in the time domain is equivalent to multiplication in the frequency domain:

$$
f(t) * g(t) \; \xleftrightarrow{\mathcal{F}} \; F(\omega) \cdot G(\omega)
$$

This allows **filtering and signal transformation** to be efficiently performed in the frequency domain.

#### **Energy Compaction (Image Compression)**

Most of an image‚Äôs energy is concentrated in **low-frequency components**.  
By discarding high-frequency coefficients, we achieve **lossy compression** with minimal perceptual degradation:

$$
E_{\text{low}} = \sum_{(u,v) \in \text{low-freq}} |F(u,v)|^2
$$

Thus, retaining a small subset of low-frequency terms preserves most visual information.

### üîë Getting Started

- Requirements: MATLAB (or GNU Octave for most scripts), sample images/audio files as referenced in the code.
- Usage: Run individual .m files to explore each concept. Modify parameters (e.g., compression ratio, number of clusters) to observe effects.
- Visualization: Most scripts include plotting for intuitive understanding.
